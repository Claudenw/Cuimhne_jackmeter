What is Jack Meter ?
--------------------

jack_meter is a basic console based DPM (Digital Peak Meter).  I wrote
it for quickly checking remote signal levels, without having to run X11
to use a pretty graphical meter such as meterbridge.

This version is modified to work with an HD77780 I2C driven display.
